          <h3>The Last Of Us Series</h3>
          <p>
            Based on the video game franchise developed by Naughty Dog, the
            series is set twenty years into a pandemic caused by a mass fungal
            infection, which causes its hosts to transform into zombie-like
            creatures and collapses society. After a global pandemic destroys
            civilization, a hardened survivor takes charge of a 14-year-old girl
            who may be humanity's last hope. Pedro Pascal (The Mandalorian,
            Wonder Woman 1984) and Bella Ramsey (HBO's His Dark Materials and
            Game of Thrones) star as Joel and Ellie.
